# Memocache
A simple memoisation library that uses the standard .NET cache

Memoisation is a caching method whereby a function is cached and keyed by it's arguments.

Memocache provides a framework for caching methods using the built-in .NET memory cache (or _any_ substitute cache you wish to use instead).

See the sample application for a simple example.
